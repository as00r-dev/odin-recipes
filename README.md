# odin-recipes

This project was made for The Odin Project.

Students were required to build a simple no CSS recipe website with 3 recipes for the HTML Foundations module and to add CSS style in the same website for the CSS Foundations module.

Process:

1.) The HTML structure was already made.

2.) A wireframe was first created in Figma : https://www.figma.com/file/lA2QCDgTShAOOkeNZ5jNsM/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

3.) Added CSS according to the wireframe.
