          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Churmur is a type of chaat and one of the more inspired offerings to
            come out of a phuchkawala's cart. It contains the usual
            suspects—potatoes, boiled motor dal, tamarind, green chillies,
            coriander, and a variety of spices and seasoning—all mixed together
            and heaped upon a shalpata plate.

          <h2>Recipe:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Soak the chhola and motor dal for about 12 hours. Wash them after
              that. Drain the chhola and set it aside. Boil the motor dal until
              it softens but remains whole (it should not disintegrate). Drain
              the motor dal and leave it to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boil the potatoes till they are tender. Peel and dice into 1-cm
              cubes, and transfer them to a mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the potatoes are boiling, add 75 g hot water to the tamarind
              and allow it to soak for 15 minutes. This will soften the tamarind
              and ensure easy extraction of the pulp. Work the tamarind between
              your fingers to separate the skin and seeds. Press to squeeze out
              all the juice and discard the seeds. You should be left with some
              smooth tamarind pulp.
            </li>
            <li>
              At this point, also roughly crush the green chillies using a
              mortar and pestle, chop coriander leaves, and slice the lime.
            </li>
            <li>
              Back to the mixing bowl with the diced potatoes: add soaked
              chhola, boiled motor dal, chopped coriander, crushed green
              chillies, lime juice, tamarind pulp, salt, rocksalt, chilli flakes
              and bhaja masala. Crush the _papri_s and add them too.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix until everything is evenly combined. Use a light hand so that
              you don’t mash the potatoes or grind the papri to a fine powder—we
              want them to remain chunky. Serve immediately.
